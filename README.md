# Welcome to typeorm-backend-basic

This is a basic banking web application that integrates: 
- Typescript
- Express
- TypeORM
- Node

This is a back end application that was used to explore typeORM and to discover how to create a back end that can connect a Node/Express application with a postgreSQL database.
Creating a REST api with all CRUD functionalities and exploring One to Many and Many to Many relationships between objects. This project is in its basic form and has no front-end.
Everything was tested with Postman. Should the project be expanded I would include a React front end with RTK Query as the way to connect between the front and the back.

This application can be run by using the `npm run dev` call inside the main folder to run `index.ts` in `nodemon`.
